# ModernPentathlonScoreTool
At my first pentathlon competition, there was a large delay at the end of the competition due to scoring the event using lookup tables. 
This repository is my non-athletic contribution to a small sport to improve the experience of scoring in a Free & Open Source manner.

## Usage
TBD

## Scoring Guidelines
The scoring algorithms are provided by the [UIPM](https://www.uipmworld.org/uipm-rules-and-regulations) and for now this tool will only focus on the latest competition rule set. 
Report an issue if rules are updated or any algorithms are found to be incorrect.

## Development
This tool is being developed in Rust because:
- I want it to eventually be a reliable standalone tool that can be a FOSS to run a competition
- I have experience coding Rust professionaly (setting up & using tools like rustfmt & clippy)
- I want practice with creating & deploying Rust projects

Because this is a learning experience for me, I want to do the development work solo until I deem this tool ready for use. Until then, please create an issue of any desired features.
